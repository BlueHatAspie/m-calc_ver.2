# m-calc_ver.2
This is just my personal implmentation of a calculator in C. Feel free to use it in your own projects.

This is a minimal calculator library implmented completely in C. It is designed to have as few dependencies as possible, making it more portable.

## How To Use
Requirements: `make` and `gcc`
